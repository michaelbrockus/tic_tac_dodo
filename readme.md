# Tic Tac Dodo for Command-line 🦤✏️

## About

* * *

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two
players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who
succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row
is the winner.

Tic-tac-dodo, is a variation of Tic tac toe in that it’s themed around playing a game
with a really smart dodo bird.

Firstly the users should set up a project build directory before
compiling:
