Targeted audience we are building for is MacOSX and Linux users. This project uses

## Setup, Compile and Install

Firstly the users should set up a project build directory before
compiling:

```console
meson setup builddir
```

The next step should be to compile the target of a configured
Meson project:

```console
meson compile -C builddir
```

Then we install the application like so:

```console
meson install -C builddir
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```
